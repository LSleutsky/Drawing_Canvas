# Drawing_Canvas
A blank drawing canvas for simple drawing / doodling

This little "app" allows you to draw on a blank white canvas by using different default colors, and it also allows you to create your own colors by creating new colors with red, green, and blue sliders.

The new color you create is added to the existing color palette, and is automatically selected to color / draw with. You can add as many colors as you like...
